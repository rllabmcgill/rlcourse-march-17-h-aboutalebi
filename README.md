# Comparision Of Different Algorithm in solving Bandit Arm Problem

Here I have tested different bandit arm algorithm by changing their parameters and then compared them with each other.

##Epsilon Greedy:

Here is the graph of greedy algorithm wih different epsilon. Note that the epsilon for Greedy line (blue line) is zero:
